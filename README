My website has been built using a template, Big picture by HTML5up. This frame work has been greatly expanded upon using various index.html, 
main.css and main.js edits as well as changes to the aesthetics and feel of the website. The changes are as follows:

#BASIC CHANGES 

The first, simplest changes that I made to the website were to the overall aesthetics. The background images used on each page, the text 
included in the various artist profile sections, the tab text were all very easy to edit in the index.html file within the following code blocks:

##TAB TEXT

<head>
	<title>Callow & Co.</title>

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no" />
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/main.css" />
